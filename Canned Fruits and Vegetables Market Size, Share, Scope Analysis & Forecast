Their long shelf life and ease of storage make them an attractive option for households looking to stock up on nutritious foods without the concern of frequent spoilage. This segment benefits from the increasing consumer preference for convenient, ready-to-use food products. Furthermore, the rise in health consciousness among consumers has led to a demand for canned options that retain nutritional value while being free from additives.
